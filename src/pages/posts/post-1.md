# blog number 1
published on : some date

welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro. Here i will share the process of learning to write basic websites using this tool.

## what i've accomplished

1. so far not much

2. but im hoping this will be useful going  forwards, for making portfolio websites, and website without much interactivity, whilst also giving scope to later learn some frameworks and being able to integrate them into this platform

## what's next

I am going to push through and finish this tutorial, and then i will probably rewrite the website i made for the cat, and maybe make a bunch of other projects and either host them on netlify, or see about hosting coolify, or dokku and hosting them myself.
